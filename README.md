# Overview
**This section provides an overview of Object, explaining what it is and how it works. It includes a brief description of the folder structure and how it enables designers to organize and share their digital assets.**

Digital assets are an essential part of the creative process, but managing and sharing these assets can be a major challenge for designers and other creatives. When assets are not properly organized, it can be difficult for designers to find the files they need, which can waste a lot of time and disrupt their creative flow. In addition, sharing large files over email or external storage devices can be inconvenient and may not be secure. As a result, designers may struggle to collaborate effectively with others, which can hinder their ability to do their best work.

In order to overcome these challenges, designers need a better way to manage and share their digital assets. This is where "Object" comes in. Object is a digital assets content browser that provides a clear and organized way to manage and share your digital assets. With Object, designers can easily visualize hundreds or thousands of files within a folder, so they can quickly find the assets they need. In addition, Object allows designers to share their libraries with others securely, so they can collaborate more effectively.

Object offers a practical solution to the challenges that creatives face when it comes to managing and sharing digital assets. With its clear and organized folder structure, Object makes it easy for designers to find the files they need, so they can spend less time searching and more time being creative.

# Getting started
**This section could provide more detailed information about how to create and manage libraries in Object, including how to add and remove categories and objects, and how to customize the library metadata.**

## Folder Structure

The folder structure of Object is an essential part of the tool, as it provides a clear and organized way for designers to manage and share their digital assets. By requiring users to follow a specific hierarchy of libraries, categories, and objects, Object ensures that digital assets are organized and easy to find.

Libraries are the top-level folders that contain multiple categories, which are subfolders that can contain both objects and other subcategories. This hierarchical structure allows designers to group their digital assets into broader categories and subcategories, making it easier to find and access the files they need. For example, a library of 3D furniture models might have categories for chairs, tables, and sofas, which would contain the individual objects (i.e., 3D models) of different furniture items.

Objects are the last folders in the path and contain the specific digital assets that designers need, along with metadata files that describe the asset and its author. This allows designers to easily access the files they need and see detailed information about the asset at a glance.

### Cover

In the Object folder structure, each object (i.e., a folder containing specific digital assets) must include a file called "cover" that visualizes the content of the object. This can be a simple image file, such as a JPEG or PNG, or a more complex file format such as a GLB (a 3D file format that can be used with augmented reality or virtual reality applications).
